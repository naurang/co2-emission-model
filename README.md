## Introduction

This project involves predicting CO2 emissions from various features of cars using a multiple linear regression model. The dataset used in this project includes features such as engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption in the city and on the highway.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
